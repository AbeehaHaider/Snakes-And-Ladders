# Snakes-And-Ladders
C++ implementation of Snakes and Ladders using a linked list board. Each tile is a node with snakes and ladders handled via special pointers. Supports multiple players, dice rolls, and full game stats. Demonstrates dynamic memory, data structures, and random number generation.

This project is a C++ implementation of the classic board game Snakes and Ladders, built around a linked list data structure rather than a simple array. The board is constructed as a chain of one hundred nodes, each representing a tile. Every node stores its position, a pointer to the next tile, and a special pointer that links to another node when a snake or ladder is present. This approach provides a more dynamic and illustrative model of the game, while also reinforcing concepts of memory allocation and pointer manipulation in C++.
The game begins by creating the board and inserting snakes and ladders at predefined positions. When a player lands on a tile that contains one of these special links, their position is immediately updated to reflect the climb of a ladder or the fall down a snake. The use of pointers makes these transitions smooth and efficient, showing how linked nodes can replace rigid array indexing to handle game mechanics.
Players are represented through a dedicated structure that tracks their position, total number of turns, and how many snakes or ladders they encounter throughout the game. The dice is simulated using random number generation, with values ranging from one to six. Each turn, the program displays the dice roll, the playerâ€™s new position, and whether they hit a snake or ladder. This creates a clear, step-by-step log of the gameplay that can be followed easily in the console.
The simulation supports multiple players, each taking turns until one of them reaches or passes tile one hundred. At that point, the program declares the winner and ends the match with a full statistical summary. This includes how many turns each player took, how many times they were bitten by snakes, and how many ladders they climbed during the course of the game.
